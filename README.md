### How will you emulate the NLS, a unique piece of software from over half a century ago?
Some (if not all) of the Nov. 1969 source code for the original NLS has actually been scanned [here](https://bitsavers.org/pdf/sri/arc/sds-940/NLS_Sources_Part_1_Nov69.pdf).  

Additionally, the (most likely?) full source code of NLS v2.0 has also been scanned [here](https://www.computerhistory.org/collections/catalog/102706982), although I will first attempt to emulate the version closest resembling that seen in Engelbart's MOAD.  

The original NLS ran on a SDS 940, [for which emulators exist](https://github.com/simh/simh). The source code seems to be written with [TREE-META](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TREE-META).
